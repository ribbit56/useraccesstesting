    "# User Access Review Script\n",
    "\n",
    "User access testing is one of the most common tasks IT auditors will undertake during their career. Checking that access to a given system is of critical importance, and auditors will spend a lot of time performing different tests on user lists provided by those being audited, or pulled using tools like PowerShell or other user management tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tests themselves are relatively straight forward and often include tasks such as checking for terminated users with enabled accounts, accounts that have been newly provisioned, and appropriateness of a person's permissions given their role within an organization. However, frequently user lists lack adequate information on their own to complete these tests. Often the solution is to take a user listing and then compare it to an HR report that contains information such as hire/termination dates and a user's role within the company. This information can be easily linked together via Excel using vlookups, or manually searching for a user within an HR report and then copying over related information. These tasks are simple enough, but often take time and are prone to user error due to their manual nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example script aims to somewhat automate the process by using two imputs: 1) a user list, and 2) an HR report (or similar). The script performs a simple join from one to the other via a primary key and then creates a .xlsx file containing the results of the join, and subsequent tabs displaying the new user (new hire) IDs, and terminated users."
